# emilsportfolio - my portfolio page

Welcome to my portfolio page!
Using React I have created a little front-end page that showcases the projects I have yet made.
Its barebones now but with time it'll grow!

## Using slick-carousel examples
If you're interested in running a slider in your React App check out the "Home" and "Projects" components as I have made use of its features quite extensively!

## Next up - a web app made in C#
So far I have covered web apps made in JavaScript and while theres still a lot to be done I'll create a small project in C# next, just to showcase what that looks like.
After that I look forward to give the Farmer Emils project some more love, stay tuned!
